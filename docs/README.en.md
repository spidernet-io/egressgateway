The gateway provides network egress capabilities for Kubernetes clusters.

Starting with 2021, we received some feedback as follows.

There are two clusters A and B. Cluster A is VMWare-based and runs mainly Database workloads, and Cluster B is a Kubernetes cluster. Some applications in Cluster B need to access the database in Cluster A, and the network administrator wants the cluster Pods to be managed through an egress gateway.

## Features

* Solve IPv4 IPv6 dual-stack connectivity.
* Solve the high availability of Egress Nodes.
* Allow filtering Pods Egress Policy (_Destination CIDR_).
* Allow filtering of egress Applications (_Pods_).
* Can be used in low kernel version.
* Support multiple egress gateways instance.
* Support namespaced egress IP.
* Supports automatic detection of cluster traffic for egress gateways policies.
* Support namespace default egress instances.
